# Improvements for V1.1 Tracker

* Move power supply and fuse away from antennas
* Consider p-channel MOSFETs instead of n-channel so we can switch the 12v
    - This will require transistor switching to interface the Linkit One
* Put places for "flywheel" diodes
* Make 0.1 drill holes larger (especially the shield edges)
